	  	<p><b>ESC Resources</b></p>	  	
	  	<p><i><font size="1">Resources are made available to Engineering Student Groups who are affiliated under the Engineers' Joint Council. Questions regarding available resources, reservations, etc. should be directed to Michelle Pang, EJC Facilities Coordinator (pangmicha@gmail.com).</font></i></p>
	  	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	  	<p><span class="ds3 ds4">*Bridges Lounge: Meeting Space</span></p>
				<p>Meeting space can be reserved by student groups on a first come, first served basis. For the purpose of Officer/Executive Meetings, the repeating time slots can be reserved for an entire semester (notices for these reservations will be sent out a week before the beginning of each semester). Priority for repeating time slots will go to those student groups who last held the reserved time.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><span class="ds3">Projector:</span></p>
				<p>The projector can be borrowed for meetings/presentations/events/etc. by any student organization under EJC. The projector is available for single day use, and must be brought back the same day it is checked out (unless you have made other arrangements with the Facilities Coordinator). The projector is lent out on a first come, first served basis. Projector screens are not available.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><span class="ds3">Funding:</span></p>
	  	<p>In addition to the allocations given to you at the beginning of each semester by the FiComm, your group has access to potential additional funds through FiComm. In order to obtain additional funding a proposal for the request must be sent to both the Senior and Junior ESC Treasurers by the Monday before the FiComm Meeting. Priority for additional funding is given for inter-societal events (mixers, socials, outreach events, etc.), etc. If you have questions regarding what qualifies for additional funds please consult the ESC Treasurers.</p>
	  	<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><span class="ds3">Power Tools:</span></p>
				<p>Currently ESC has an assortment of power (hand) tools that can be used by student groups for various projects. Originally these tools were purchased for use by TBP's PiE Crust (Robotics Team), so naturally this group has precedence for use. However, the tools must still be checked out, and are on a first come, first served basis (i.e. if PiE Crust and another organization request use of the tools for the same time, and the request is received at the same time, then PiE Crust will get to borrow the tools, but if your groups makes a request a week before PiE Crust for the same time, then your group will get to borrow the tools). PiE Crust is allowed to make arrangements to borrow the tools at the beginning of the semester (and can make rollover requests, i.e. &quot;every MWF from 4-6PM&quot;), at the same time as other student groups.</p>
	  	<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><span class="ds3">Lockers:</span></p>
				<p>Lockers for storage are available for by groups under ESC. Locker space is available through registration forms, and precedence for space goes to groups who currently have lockers in Bridges Lounge. However, we are looking to add more lockers, so if you are interested in getting a locker, please let the Facilities Coordinator know.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><span class="ds3">Easels (4):</span></p>
				<p>There are four easels available for check out from ESC. These can be rented for a week at a time, so that you can use them to advertise events, set up displays, etc. If you need the easel for more than a week you will need to make arrangements with the Facilities Coordinator. If an easel is lost/stolen when it is under your group's name, it is your responsibility to replace it, or pay a penalty fee.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><span class="ds3">Mailboxes:</span></p>
	  	<p>Mailboxes (currently located in Bridges Lounge) are available for ESC-registered student groups who would like to have an on-campus mailing address. Mailboxes can be requested through your registration form, or by contacting either the Facilities Coordinator or the ESC President directly. We will do our best to ensure that all student groups who request a mailbox will be given one.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><span class="ds3">Sports Equipment:</span></p>
	  	<p>There are cones, flags and jerseys (for flag football or capture the flag, etc.), and NERF guns available for student groups to borrow.&nbsp; Equipment can be checked out through the Facilities Coordinator. Items can be checked out for a day or over the weekend (starting Friday afternoon); other arrangements can be made as well, but you will need to consult the Facilities Coordinator.</p>
				<p>&nbsp;</p>
				<p><span class="ds3">Copier (and Computer Use):</span></p>
				<p>Should our request for a photo copier (B&amp;W) be approved, we would allot each ESC-Student Group some number of copies per semester. Additional copies would have to be requested, after all the allotted copies have been used, and may potentially be at cost to the society.</p>
